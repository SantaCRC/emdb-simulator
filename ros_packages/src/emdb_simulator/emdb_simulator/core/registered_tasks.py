"""Registry of custom task modules.

Each import below registers that task class with robosuite as a side
effect (see the individual task module's own docstring). scene_loader
imports this module once instead of importing every task module directly.

New entries are appended by scripts/create_task.py -- keep one import per
line and don't remove the trailing marker comment.
