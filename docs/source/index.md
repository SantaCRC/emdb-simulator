# EMDB Simulator Documentation

EMDB is a ROS 2 workspace that wraps [RoboCasa](https://github.com/SantaCRC/robocasa) /
[robosuite](https://github.com/SantaCRC/robosuite) kitchen-manipulation simulation behind a
ROS 2 topic/service interface, so that teleoperation, demo recording, and RL
training/inference can all talk to the simulator without depending on
robosuite/robocasa/MuJoCo directly.

## At a glance

- **{ref}`emdb_simulator`** — owns the MuJoCo/robosuite/RoboCasa
  environment, steps physics, and publishes observations/joint states/object
  poses while exposing action services.
- **{ref}`emdb_policy`** — a separate process that consumes the
  simulator's ROS interface only; hosts a `gymnasium.Env` wrapper, an SB3 PPO
  training script, and a demo-replay tool.
- **[emdb_interfaces](interfaces/index.md)** — the custom `.msg`/`.srv` definitions shared
  between the two.
